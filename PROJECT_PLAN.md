---

## 5. Methodology Breakdown

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (Day 1 - FAST TRACK)

**Quick EDA (2 hours):**
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load datasets
from datasets import load_dataset
therapy_data = load_dataset('counsel_chat')  # Example
dialog_data = load_dataset('daily_dialog')

# Quick stats
print(f"Therapy dataset size: {len(therapy_data['train'])}")
print(f"Dialog dataset size: {len(dialog_data['train'])}")

# Visualize
df.hist(column='text_length', bins=50)
plt.show()
```

**DDD-Based Preprocessing Pipeline ([DONE] IMPLEMENTED):**
```python
# Import from domain services
from src.domain.services.text_preprocessor import TextPreprocessingService

# Initialize with configuration
preprocessor = TextPreprocessingService(
    remove_stopwords=True,
    apply_stemming=False,
    apply_lemmatization=True,
    remove_urls=True,
    remove_html=True
)

# Single text preprocessing
text = "Check out https://example.com for more info!"
processed = preprocessor.preprocess(text)
print(processed)  # "check info"

# Batch preprocessing
texts = ["I feel anxious", "I am depressed", "Help me please"]
processed_batch = preprocessor.batch_preprocess(texts)

# Compare preprocessing methods
comparison = preprocessor.compare_preprocessing_methods(
    "The cats are running quickly through the garden"
)
for method, result in comparison.items():
    print(f"{method}: {result}")

# [DONE] 27 unit tests with 100% code coverage
# [DONE] See tests/unit/domain/test_text_preprocessor.py
```

**NLP Techniques Applied:**
[DONE] Tokenization (NLTK word_tokenize)
[DONE] Stopword removal (compare impact)
[DONE] Stemming (Porter Stemmer)
[DONE] Lemmatization (WordNet)
[DONE] All documented for paper

### Phase 2: Embeddings (Day 2-3 - Use Pre-trained)

**Approach: Leverage existing embeddings for speed**

**Static Embeddings (Psychotherapy Bot):**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import gensim.downloader as api

# TF-IDF (traditional baseline)
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(texts)

# Pre-trained Word2Vec (Google News)
word2vec_model = api.load('word2vec-google-news-300')

# Pre-trained GloVe
glove_model = api.load('glove-twitter-200')
```

**Contextual Embeddings (Both Bots):**
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# DistilBERT (fast, lightweight)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')

def get_embeddings(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
```

**Quick Comparison (document in paper):**
- TF-IDF: Fast, sparse, no semantics
- Word2Vec: Dense, semantic similarity
- DistilBERT: Contextual, best performance

**Time Saver:** Use pre-trained models, no training from scratch!

## 20. Conclusion

This project plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a state-of-the-art conversational agent while meeting all course requirements. The key to success is:

1. **Start early** - Don't underestimate the time needed
2. **Iterate frequently** - Regular testing and refinement
3. **Document thoroughly** - Track all experiments and decisions
4. **Collaborate effectively** - Leverage team strengths
5. **Seek feedback** - From instructor, peers, and users
6. **Stay organized** - Use project management tools
7. **Be original** - Add unique insights and approaches

**Remember:** Quality over quantity. Focus on depth of analysis and clear communication of findings.
