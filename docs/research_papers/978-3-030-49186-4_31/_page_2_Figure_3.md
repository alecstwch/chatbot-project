**Fig. 1.** Search results in Scopus by year for "chatbot" or "conversation agent" or "conversational interface" as keywords from 2000 to 2019.

This line graph depicts the annual number of academic publications (documents) related to chatbot technology over a two-decade period. The trend reveals three distinct phases:

1.  **Period of Minimal Activity (2000–circa 2008):** The number of documents remains very low, consistently below 50 per year. This indicates that chatbot research was a niche academic field during this era.
2.  **Period of Steady, Moderate Growth (circa 2009–2015):** A clear upward trajectory begins, with the annual document count rising from under 50 to approximately 200. This reflects a growing but gradual interest in the domain.
3.  **Period of Explosive Growth (2016–2019):** The graph shows a dramatic, near-vertical increase. Starting from around 200 documents in 2015, the number surges to well over 1000 by 2019. This phase represents a massive acceleration in research output and community interest, aligning with the commercialization and widespread adoption of conversational AI and virtual assistants in the late 2010s.

Overall, the data visualizes a pivotal shift: chatbot technology evolved from a specialized research topic into a major, high-impact area of study within computer science and human-computer interaction.
