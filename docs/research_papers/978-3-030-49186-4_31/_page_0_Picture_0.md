**Fig. 0.** (Assumed) Book or Publication Cover

**Image Analysis:**

This image appears to be the cover of a book or conference proceedings volume. The primary text displayed is the title:
**"Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations"**

Beneath the main title, there is a series identifier, likely indicating it is part of a lecture notes series:
**"IFIP WG 12.5 International Workshops"**

Further down, the specific workshops and publication details are listed:
*   **"ARTIS 2020, NeSy 2020, 5G-PINE 2020, AI-Bio 2020, and MHDW 2020"** – These are the acronyms for the workshops included in this volume.
*   **"Neos Marmaras, Greece, June 5–7, 2020, Proceedings"** – This specifies the location and date of the event, and confirms this is the proceedings from those workshops.

The cover features a stylized, abstract graphic design in the background, which is typical for academic publications in computer science. The overall layout and information indicate this is the cover page for the compiled proceedings of multiple IFIP workshops focused on various specialized topics within Artificial Intelligence, held in Greece in 2020.
