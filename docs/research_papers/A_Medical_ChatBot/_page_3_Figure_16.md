**Fig 4: plot of Algorithm Accuracy after comparison of different method**

**Image Analysis:** This image is a line graph that visually compares the performance accuracy of three different classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The x-axis lists the three algorithms, and the y-axis represents the accuracy percentage.

The graph clearly shows the SVM Classifier achieving the highest accuracy at approximately 94.67% (0.9466667). The KNN algorithm follows with an accuracy of about 88.67% (0.8866667), and the Naïve Bayes algorithm has the lowest accuracy among the three at 80% (0.8). The plot effectively demonstrates the superior performance of the SVM algorithm for the given task in this medical chatbot system.
