**Figure 1. Flow diagram of included studies**

**Image Analysis:** The image is a PRISMA flow diagram detailing the study selection process for a systematic review. The process began with searches across five databases: PubMed (n=102), Embase (n=159), PsychInfo (n=414), CINAHL (n=265), and ACM Digital (n=776). After removing 203 duplicates, 1513 records remained for title and abstract screening. This screening excluded 1395 records. Search updates identified 3 additional records. A total of 121 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 106 were excluded. From this, 15 articles were selected. A final screening of reference lists added 2 more articles, resulting in **17 studies (representing 14 different conversational agents)** being included in the final review.

**Data Flow and Connections:**
The flowchart illustrates the following connections and data flow:

1.  The search starts with individual database searches: **PubMed (n=102), Embase (n=159), PsychInfo (n=414), CINAHL (n=265), ACM Digital (n=776)**.
2.  The results from all databases are combined, and **Duplicates removed (n=203)**.
3.  The remaining records (n=1513) undergo **Title and abstract screening**, with inter-coder agreement measured by Kappa (k=0.45).
4.  A large number of records are **1395 papers excluded** based on title and abstract screening. **Search updates (n=3)** are added for the next stage.
5.  The remaining records (n=121) undergo **Full-text screening**, with inter-coder agreement measured by Kappa (k=0.53).
6.  A further **106 papers excluded** based on full-text screening.
7.  The remaining records (n=15) are supplemented by **Reference list screening (n=2)**.
8.  The process culminates in **Articles included in systematic review (n=17)**, representing **14 Conversational Agents**.
