**Figure 2. Characteristics of included conversational agents in terms of task-orientation, dialogue management, and dialogue initiative.**

**Image Analysis:** The image shows a hierarchical diagram titled **"Figure 2. Characteristics of included conversational agents in terms of task-orientation, dialogue management, and dialogue initiative."**

It categorizes the 14 conversational agents from the systematic review:

*   **Conversational agents (N=14)**
    *   **Task-oriented (N=8)**
        *   **Finite-state (N=6)** → **System** initiative
        *   **Frame-based (N=2)** → **Mixed** initiative
    *   **Not task-oriented (N=6)**
        *   **Frame-based (N=5)** → **Mixed** initiative
        *   **Agent-based (N=1)** → **User** initiative

The diagram visually summarizes the breakdown of how the included agents were designed in terms of their purpose (task-oriented or not), their underlying dialogue control method, and who primarily leads the conversation.

**Diagram Layers and Connections:**

The diagram is structured in three distinct layers:

1.  **Top Layer:** The root node represents all **Conversational agents (N=14)** in the systematic review.
2.  **Middle Layer (Task-orientation):** The root node branches into two categories based on the agents' primary purpose:
    *   **Task-oriented (N=8)**: Agents designed to complete a specific, goal-oriented task (e.g., data collection, clinical interview).
    *   **Not task-oriented (N=6)**: Agents designed for more open-ended conversation (e.g., education, general support).
3.  **Bottom Layer (Dialogue management and Dialogue initiative):** This layer further subdivides the agents based on their technical architecture and conversational control:
    *   From **Task-oriented (N=8)**:
        *   A connection leads to **Finite-state (N=6)** agents, which in turn are connected to **System** initiative. This means these agents follow a strict, pre-defined conversation path controlled by the system.
        *   A connection leads to **Frame-based (N=2)** agents, which are connected to **Mixed** initiative. This allows for more flexible conversation where both the user and system can take the lead to fill in required information slots.
    *   From **Not task-oriented (N=6)**:
        *   A connection leads to **Frame-based (N=5)** agents, also connected to **Mixed** initiative.
        *   A connection leads to **Agent-based (N=1)** agent, which is connected to **User** initiative. This indicates a system where the user primarily drives the conversation, and the agent responds dynamically.

The lines between the boxes represent the hierarchical relationships and the flow of categorization, showing how the total pool of 14 agents is distributed across different design characteristics.
