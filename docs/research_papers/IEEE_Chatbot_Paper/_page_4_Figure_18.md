**Image Analysis:** The image contains two side-by-side screenshots of the chatbot interface in action. The left screenshot shows a user asking about IT department branches. The chatbot responds by listing specific B.Tech and M.Tech programs offered by the Department of Information and Communication Technology and provides links for more information. The right screenshot shows a user asking for the university's location. The chatbot provides the full postal address in Manipal, Karnataka, and displays a map of India with Manipal's location highlighted. These examples demonstrate the chatbot's functionality in providing detailed academic program information and geographical location data.
