\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
In case you’re presenting a survey: explain main methodologies and selection process (i.e. you are surveying either chronologically, or in order of SOTA achievements), discuss advantages and disadvantages to the methods used and introduced
 
In the case of presenting specific applications: describe the method, compare it with other results in the field

\subsection{Dataset}
\label{subsec:dataset}

What does it look like? How was this data obtained? Was it annotated manually/automatically? What is the data distribution? What do you expect to be relevant for your model considering the data?

\subsection{Preprocessing}
\label{subsec:preprocessing}

What preprocessing methods did you try? Why did you chose them? How did they affect the model?

\subsection{Method}
\label{subsec:method}

Models you are using: why did you chose them, how do they work, why did you chose those hyperparameters. Mention if you modified an already existing model, how and why.

Experiments: compare your experiments with the already existing SOTA. Explain the context briefly.

Scores are irrelevant unless compared with a baseline. If all experiments have 98\% accuracy, either the dataset was bad or your implementation has a grave mistake. Don't get happy too quickly.

Feature Importance: can you manually interpret the result in any way? If not, why?
