We thank the course instructors for their guidance on domain-driven design principles and NLP project best practices. We are grateful to the open-source community, particularly the developers of PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), NLTK, and AIML, whose libraries made this work possible.

We acknowledge the creators of the Mental Health Counseling Conversations dataset and the Daily Dialog dataset for making their data publicly available. Special thanks to Microsoft Research for releasing DialoGPT and OpenAI for GPT-2, enabling academic research on conversational AI.

Finally, we appreciate the broader NLP research community for establishing evaluation methodologies, error analysis frameworks, and ethical guidelines that informed our approach.
