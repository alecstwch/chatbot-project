\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

This section outlines known limitations of the implemented systems and areas that require further development.

\subsection{Evaluation Limitations}

\textbf{No Formal Assessment}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We did not perform systematic evaluation of response quality
    \item No comparison metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.) were collected
    \item No human evaluation of empathy, appropriateness, or clinical safety
    \item Performance characteristics are anecdotal rather than measured
\end{itemize}

This limits our ability to make definitive claims about the relative quality of responses from each architecture. Future work should include comprehensive evaluation using both automatic metrics and human assessment.

\subsection{AIML Limitations}

\textbf{Coverage}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited to 150+ hand-crafted patterns
    \item Cannot handle novel inputs outside predefined rules
    \item Brittle to phrasing variations
    \item Scaling requires significant manual effort
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Flexibility}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Responses are static and predetermined
    \item No adaptation to user preferences or patterns
    \item No learning from interactions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DialoGPT Limitations}

\textbf{Memory}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Session-based only, no persistence
    \item Each conversation starts without context from past sessions
    \item Cannot track patient progress or patterns over time
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Control}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited control over generated responses
    \item May generate inappropriate or clinically unsafe content
    \item No domain-specific customization for mental health
    \item Training on Reddit data may not transfer optimally to therapy
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resource Requirements}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 450MB model download required
    \item CPU inference is slow (200-500ms)
    \item GPU significantly improves speed but adds hardware requirement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RAG-Enhanced Limitations}

\textbf{Complexity}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple services increase failure modes
    \item Requires Qdrant, MongoDB, and Gemini API
    \item Setup and configuration more involved
    \item Debugging distributed systems is challenging
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dependencies}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requires external Gemini API (network dependency)
    \item Qdrant and MongoDB must be properly configured
    \item API rate limits and costs for production use
    \item Data backup strategy required for persistent stores
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Domain Services}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emotion detection is keyword-based, may miss nuanced expressions
    \item Behavior pattern recognition is rule-based, limited to predefined patterns
    \item No learning or adaptation from new patterns
    \item May not generalize across cultures or demographics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Limitations}

\textbf{Clinical Safety}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item None of the systems are clinically validated
    \item No professional review of response quality
    \item Risk assessment is heuristic, not clinically grounded
    \item Crisis detection exists but escalation protocols are not implemented
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Language Support}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All systems designed for English only
    \item No multi-language support
    \item Cultural bias in training data and patterns
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Accessibility}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CLI interface may not be accessible to all users
    \item No GUI or web interface implemented
    \item No support for alternative input methods (voice, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation Limitations}

\textbf{Incomplete Coverage}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Some code paths may not be fully documented
    \item API documentation could be more comprehensive
    \item Usage examples limited to CLI interface
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Testing}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited test coverage beyond preprocessing
    \item No integration tests for end-to-end workflows
    \item No tests for data isolation guarantees
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Acknowledged Gaps}

We acknowledge that this project focuses on implementation rather than evaluation. The systems demonstrate architectural approaches but do not provide evidence of their effectiveness or superiority. Future work should address:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Systematic evaluation of response quality
    \item Clinical validation of safety and appropriateness
    \item User studies measuring engagement and helpfulness
    \item Comparison with baseline or commercial systems
\end{itemize}
